# GET-HOURLY-RITM-PRODUCTION-AND-ESTIMATION-DATA-WITH-PYTHON
RITM project aims to estimate the electrical power to be produced in electricity generation facilities operated by wind energy, which is an intermittent energy source. 
The code I wrote gets the background version of the data graphed on the relevant RITM website and transfrom into tables. The modules used are requests, pandas, urllib, 
BeautifulSoup, os and datetime.
